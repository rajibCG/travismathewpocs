# Component naming and creation

When creating components for either Contentstack or in the react/nextjs app, we need to refer to one of the components listed under the project structure.
This document should serve as a North Star, and we should avoid deviating from the naming when creating new components.

<b>Example:</b>
In many cases, a component like the Portrait Card may have different variations.
A variation is a representation of the component that has certain data points (properties).

In this case, the v0 Portrait Card shows several properties, that could be named like: Image, Category, Title, Price, Swatches, CTA and Badge, while a different
variation of the card, like the v3 might show only an Image and a Title

<div className="inline">
  <img src="PortraitCardv0.png" width="300" />
  <img src="PortraitCardv1.png" width="300" />
  <img src="PortraitCardv2.png" width="300" />
  <img src="PortraitCardv3.png" width="300" />
  <img src="PortraitCardv4.png" width="300" />
</div>

In order to make it easier for the business to work with these different variations, our standard practice is
to setup variations within a Contenstack content model, and a matching variation within our react component library.

We should limit the number of options that are available here to promote simplicity. The content model can have all the fields for all the different variations,
and each react component and css will be responsible for taking the fields they need and representing them in markup and responsive css.

Therefore, each Content Model we create in ContentStack must have a variation dropdown if there are multiple possible representations of the component.

Finally, on the React side, we'll create a folder for that component as well as its available variations:
