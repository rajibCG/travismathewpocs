# Code linting/formatting

<p>
  The Prettier linting formatter is a popular code formatting tool used in the
  development community. It helps enforce consistent code style and formatting
  across different projects and codebases. Prettier is language-agnostic,
  meaning it supports multiple programming languages, including JavaScript,
  TypeScript, CSS, HTML, JSON, and more. Unlike traditional linters, Prettier
  focuses solely on code formatting and does not provide code analysis or issue
  reporting. It automatically parses your code and rewrites it to adhere to a
  predefined set of formatting rules, ensuring a consistent and uniform code
  style. In the future we'll enfore more linting rules, but please adhere to the
  [**Airbnb React/JSX
  guide**](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)

</p>

<p>
  We use the prettier code formatter to setup consistency in our development
  style. Visual Studio Code is recommended, but any IDE/code editor is fine as
  long as it can implement the Format on Save feature from Prettier. You can
  find the supported editors on this page: [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io/)
</p>

Please look at the setup instructions here and ensure that you have Format on Save
enabled. [**Prettier plugin for VS Code**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
