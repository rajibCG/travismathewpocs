# TravisMathew Design System

The TravisMathew design system is a comprehensive collection of design guidelines, components, and patterns that ensure consistency and maintainability across all of TravisMathew's products and services. This design system is the backbone of the TravisMathew brand, providing a cohesive and unified user experience for customers.

To make it easier for developers and designers to work with the TravisMathew design system, the team has created a Storybook documentation website. The TravisMathew Design System Storybook provides a centralized location where all of the design system's components and guidelines are documented and presented in a clear and easy-to-navigate format.

The Storybook site includes an extensive library of reusable components that developers and designers can use to quickly build and prototype new features and products. Each component is thoroughly documented with code examples, design guidelines, and usage instructions, making it easy to understand and implement.

In addition to the component library, the Storybook site also includes comprehensive documentation on the TravisMathew design system's color palette, typography, layout grid, CSS methodology and other design elements. This documentation provides developers and designers with a shared understanding of the design system, helping to ensure consistency across all of TravisMathew's products and services.
